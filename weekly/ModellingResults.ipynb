    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used for modelling are MISR data with (1) species concentration and (2) PM2.5 concentration from 2000-2021. Both datasets are then merged with daily information on fire clusters and smoke plumes that are close to each site. Each dataset is linked below for future reproduction of the experiments.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "Variables used in modelling include:\n",
    "- Temporal: year, month\n",
    "- Spatial: site longitude, site latitude, elevation\n",
    "- Fire: distance (km) to closest fire cluster, average & variance of closest cluster's FRP, number of points in closest cluster\n",
    "- Smoke: binary variables for whether the site lies in light, medium, and/or heavy smoke plume\n",
    "- AOD: AOD, AOD products\n",
    "- Other: land code of site (representing ecosystem), sampling method (POC)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformation & Imputation\n",
    "All continuous independent variables are transformed using the [Standard Scaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html#sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.fit_transform) and categorical features are one-hot encoded. We also noticed a heavily right-skewed distribution for the target variables, so we log-transformed them during modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there were a lot of missing values for AOD, imputation was also attempted to see if it helps with model performance. Values were imputed using KNN examining its 10 most similar neighbors. Since KNN is robust to outliers, they were not removed in this step. In the experiments below, we will be comparing models fit on non-imputed data (i.e. dataset with non-NAs for AOD features) and imputed data (i.e. dataset including all observations, imputing NAs for AOD).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training the models\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was split into 70% training and 30% test. Since the purpose of these models at the moment is to investigate the importance of AOD, fire, and smoke information for predicting concentration, we only experimented with XGBoost and Random Forest to maintain interpretability. More complex models can be fitted later on if desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, outliers are defined as values 3 times the 75th percentile of the variable. They were removed from the non-imputed and imputed datasets prior to training. Missing values for non-AOD variables (including the target) were also dropped as we did not have the means to impute them.\n",
