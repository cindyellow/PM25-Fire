## Tasks
### Week 1

1. Go through the HMS description [website](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/land/hms.html) and examine data retrieval, product information.
2. Determine the time frame of the data, its structure, and whether we can solely rely on the hazard mapping system (HMS) as a data source.
3. Download a data sample and map it.

### Week 2

[x] 1. Figure out if we can calculate smoke area.
[] 2. Investigate how to link information between the smoke and fire detection datasets.
[] 3. Create better visualizations of the smoke KML data.
[x] 4. Create histograms of fire detection times throughout the day and color by satellite/method of detection to see if they always collect data at the same times.
[] 5. Examine the change of fire points overtime, specifically for the California campfire (November 7th, 2018 - November 16th, 2018).
[x] 6. Summary of ecosystem types (variable "ecosys").
[] 7. Look into how to structure the fire dataset.
  - Want to use fire as a predictor for the two projects
  - Would be useful to get information on area, intensity, smoke amount
[] 8. Check out [FEER.v1](https://feer.gsfc.nasa.gov/projects/emissions/): do they have data available, or do we only have access to the model? Can we combine this data with the HMS data based on location?

### Week 3
[x] 1. Clip data to California's borders
[x] 2. Smoke dataset visualization
[] 3. Fire detection points by time
